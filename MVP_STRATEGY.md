# 🎯 SCK MVP Strategy - Focused Approach

## Overview

The SCK (Secure Code KnAIght) platform is a **privacy-first digital twin system** for decentralized AI-driven developer coordination. This document outlines our focused MVP strategy.

## 🎯 **MVP Core Value Proposition**

**"Allow a SaaS client to define their org structure using a curated set of security-aware non-dev roles, then assign humans to those roles. Each assignment becomes a digital twin, which collects signals and certifications to mint a soulbound NFT."**

### **Key Differentiators**
- ✅ **Zero PII Storage** - No personal names, emails, or wallet addresses
- ✅ **DID-Only Assignment** - DID is the human assignment (organization resolves DID to employee)
- ✅ **Platform Remains "Blind"** - No PII stored, organization handles human resolution
- ✅ **Security-Focused Non-Dev Roles** - Business/security roles, not just dev roles
- ✅ **Privacy by Design** - GDPR-compliant architecture from day one

## 🏗️ **Current MVP Status**

### ✅ **What's Working**
1. **Core Digital Twin Creation**
   - Privacy-preserving form with DID assignment
   - Non-dev role template selection (SOC Analyst, Compliance Officer, etc.)
   - Real-time validation and error handling

2. **Dashboard & Analytics**
   - Live statistics (total twins, active twins, DID coverage)
   - Recent twins list with privacy-preserving display
   - Demo twins showcase

3. **Technical Foundation**
   - Next.js 15 with TypeScript
   - Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL schema
   - Environment validation system
   - API endpoints for twin management

4. **Mock SaaS Customer**
   - SecureCorp (cybersecurity consulting firm)
   - Real-world use case demonstration
   - Sample digital twins with DID assignments
