# 🎯 SCK MVP Strategy

## Vision Statement

The SCK (Secure Code KnAIght) platform is a **privacy-first role agent system** for decentralized AI-driven developer coordination. This document outlines our focused MVP strategy.

> **Core Value Proposition**: "Organizations define security-focused roles, assign team members to those roles. Each assignment becomes a role agent, which collects signals and certifications to mint a soulbound NFT."**

## 🏆 MVP Goals

### Primary Objective
Build a **trust-based credentialing system** that enables organizations to:
1. **Core Role Agent Creation**
   - Define organization structure with security-aware roles
   - Assign team members to specific roles using DID (Decentralized Identifiers)
   - Create role agents that collect trust signals and achievements
   - Mint blockchain-verified role credentials

### Success Metrics
- Organizations can complete role agent creation flow
- Role agents accumulate verified trust signals
- NFT credentials are successfully minted and validated
- Trust scores accurately reflect role performance

## 🎯 Target Customers

### Primary: **SaaS Security Teams** (B2B)
- **Size**: 10-500 developers
- **Industry**: Financial services, healthcare, cybersecurity
- **Pain Point**: Lack of verifiable security role credentials
- **Budget**: $10-50k/year for security tooling

### Sample role agents with DID assignments:
- `Security Engineer` → `did:ethr:0x1234...`
- `DevOps Engineer` → `did:ethr:0x5678...`
- `Frontend Developer` → `did:ethr:0x9ABC...`

**Goal**: Make role agent creation as simple as possible
