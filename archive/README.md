# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived code and configurations that are no longer actively used in the current SCK Platform development.

## Archived Items

### `apps/sck/`
**Archived Date**: December 2024  
**Reason**: Empty directory causing unnecessary compilation in turbo monorepo  
**Impact**: Removed to ensure single, clean compilation of `apps/web` only

## Archive Policy

- **Purpose**: Keep codebase clean and focused
- **Retention**: Archive rather than delete for potential future reference
- **Documentation**: Each archived item should have a README explaining why it was archived
- **Recovery**: Archived items can be restored if needed for reference or migration

## Current Active Development

**Focus**: `apps/web` - Main SCK Platform application
- Next.js application
- Magic Link authentication
- Role Agent management
- ANS integration foundation
- External signal processing
