# Gap Analysis for Phase 1 and Phase 2

This document outlines the identified gaps in the project for finalizing Phase 1 (Core Functionality & MVP) and Phase 2 (Polish, Scalability & Production Readiness).

## Phase 1: Core Functionality & MVP

This phase focuses on getting the core features of the application built, tested, and ready for a minimum viable product (MVP) release.

### Frontend

*   [ ] **Placeholder Content:** The main page (`app/page.tsx`) contains placeholder content and needs to be replaced with a proper landing page.
*   [ ] **Component Implementation:** Several components in `app/page.tsx` are included but not fully implemented or integrated into a cohesive user flow (`DigitalTwinFlow`, `NftMint`, `RoleSelection`, `SignalCollection`).
*   [ ] **User Flow:** The user flow for creating a digital twin, collecting signals, and minting an NFT is not clearly defined or implemented.
*   [ ] **Missing UI:** There is no UI for viewing a single digital twin's details, including its signals and certifications.

### Backend

*   [ ] **Incomplete API Endpoints:** The `twin-import` API endpoint is not implemented.
*   [ ] **Missing API Endpoints:** There are no API endpoints for updating or deleting existing resources (e.g., digital twins, organizations).
*   [ ] **Authentication & Authorization:** There is no authentication or authorization middleware to protect the API endpoints.
*   [ ] **Error Handling:** The API error handling is basic and could be improved to provide more specific error messages.

### Blockchain

*   [ ] **Contract ABIs:** The ABI definitions in `lib/contracts` are empty.
*   [ ] **Contract Addresses:** The `NftMint` component and `BlockchainService` use placeholder contract addresses.
*   [ ] **Minting Logic:** The `mintSckNft` function in `BlockchainService` is commented out.
*   [ ] **Signal to NFT Integration:** The `processSignalToNft` function in `lib/integrations/signal-to-nft.ts` is not fully implemented.

### Testing

*   [ ] **Missing Tests:** There are no tests for the API endpoints or the frontend components.
*   [ ] **Incomplete Tests:** The existing tests in `lib/__tests__` are basic and do not cover all the functionality.

## Phase 2: Polish, Scalability & Production Readiness

This phase focuses on refining the application, improving user experience, adding comprehensive testing, and ensuring security and scalability.

### Frontend

*   [ ] **UI/UX Polish:** The overall UI/UX needs to be polished and improved for a better user experience.
*   [ ] **Responsiveness:** The application needs to be tested and optimized for different screen sizes.
*   [ ] **Internationalization:** The application is not yet internationalized.
*   [ ] **Accessibility:** The application needs to be audited for accessibility and improved to meet WCAG standards.

### Backend

*   [ ] **Scalability:** The backend needs to be tested for scalability and optimized for performance.
*   [ ] **Security:** The application needs to be audited for security vulnerabilities and hardened against attacks.
*   [ ] **Logging & Monitoring:** A comprehensive logging and monitoring solution needs to be implemented.
*   [ ] **Rate Limiting:** Rate limiting should be implemented on the API endpoints to prevent abuse.

### Blockchain

*   [ ] **Gas Optimization:** The smart contracts should be audited for gas optimization.
*   [ ] **Security Audit:** The smart contracts should be audited by a third-party security firm.
*   [ ] **Mainnet Deployment:** The smart contracts need to be deployed to the mainnet.

### Testing

*   [ ] **End-to-End Tests:** End-to-end tests should be written to test the complete user flow.
*   [ ] **Performance Tests:** Performance tests should be conducted to ensure the application can handle a large number of users.
*   [ ] **Security Tests:** Security tests should be performed to identify and fix any security vulnerabilities.

### Documentation

*   [ ] **API Documentation:** The API endpoints should be documented using a tool like Swagger or OpenAPI.
*   [ ] **User Documentation:** User documentation should be created to help users understand how to use the application.
