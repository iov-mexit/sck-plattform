This publication introduces the topic of emerging cybersecurity risks and explains how organizations can improve their ability to address such risks through existing practices within the cyber risk discipline in conjunction with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0. The guide also emphasizes the importance of integrating these practices with organizational enterprise risk management (ERM) to proactively address emerging risks before they occur.
